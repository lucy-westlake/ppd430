        "Plot #1 demonstrates the number of incidents by zipcode. The dark blue is the whole LA City area, and there are unreported times; hence, there is no \"inferno\" color. This graphic shows that fewer incidents tend to be on the west side of LA and the outer parts of the city, while more incidents occur in the southern parts of LA. Generally, the warmer and lighter (yellow and orange) have more incidents (up to 140 reports), while the cool tones (navy and purple) have fewer incidents (around 20 to 40 reports). It is interesting to see how far of a range different zip codes have of needing fire station help, as there are almost 100 reports differences from one neighboring zip code to another."

        "Plot #2 demonstrates the LA City area's media household income by zip code. The dark blue is the whole LA City area, and there are unreported times; hence, there is no \"plasma\" color. This graphic shows that the higher household incomes tend to be on the west side of LA and the outer parts of the city, while the median household income decreases in the southern parts of LA. Generally, the warmer and lighter (yellow and orange) are wealthier (up to 200,000 dollars), while the cool tones (navy and purple) are poorer (down to 40,000 dollars). When comparing to Plot #1, it shows the same trends as the west and outer parts have less Number of incidents in the southern part of LA. This could tell a story or infer that wealthier neighborhoods/zip codes do not have as many incidents or need as much fire station help as the poorer zip codes."

        "Plot #3 demonstrates the LA City area's average response time by zip code. The dark blue is the whole LA City area, and there are unreported times; hence, there is no \"plasma\" color. On average, almost all zip codes have a response time of less than 10 minutes. With a range of 6-10 minutes, it is shown that the outer parts and east side of LA tend to take more time, as they show a warmer and lighter color (yellow and orange, taking 9 to 10 minutes). At the same time, the rest is cooler tones (blue and purple, taking 6 to 8 minutes). It would be helpful to gather even more data, but when comparing to Plot #1, it is interesting to note that the number of incidents does not directly line up with the average response time, like how the median household income (Plot #2) correlates with the number of incidents. It does have some telling that where there are fewer incidents, the average response time tends to be slower, and where there are more incidents, the response time can be faster, but it is not always true in every zip code. This is interesting to note for bigger data sets, if there is a sign of correlation."
